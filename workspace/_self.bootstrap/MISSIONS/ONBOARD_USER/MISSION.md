# ONBOARD_USER

This is the default first mission for a freshly bootstrapped `self/` repo.

This mission is mirrored by the `<onboarding>...</onboarding>` block in
`AGENTS.md`. While onboarding is active, that block should remain present. Once
onboarding is complete, mark this mission `inactive` and delete that XML block
from `AGENTS.md` in the same processing loop.

## Mission outcome

Success means:
- the user understands the basic `self/` layout
- the user understands the default scheduled jobs
- the user knows they can ask for new tools and new scheduled jobs in plain English
- `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, and related files contain real durable facts
- the user's person note exists in `VAULT/people/`
- `USER.md` links to that person note

## Conversation goals

During onboarding, explain:
- what you can help with in plain language before explaining any internals
- ongoing work, saved notes, and recurring check-ins in plain language first
- `MISSIONS/`, `VAULT/`, and `HEARTBEAT.md` only after the plain-language
  explanation
- that `HEARTBEAT.md` and knowledge extraction are the only built-in scheduled
  jobs, if the user wants that level of detail
- if you use the word "cron", explain it as a recurring scheduled prompt in
  everyday language

Tell the user they can always ask you what tools you have.

Give concrete examples of extensibility, including examples like:
- "Make a new tool for checking my Gmail."
- "Let's set up your web browser. How do I give you a budget for that?"
- "Schedule a new job every weekday morning at 7am that does X."
- "List all crons."
- "List all scheduled jobs."

Also direct the user to give the agent its own email account. Recommend:
- AgentMail for a simple agent-specific inbox
- Gmail if the user prefers using an existing Google-based account

## Tone

- Assume the user is nontechnical unless they clearly show otherwise.
- Do not introduce yourself primarily as software infrastructure.
- Prefer short, helpful, everyday phrasing.
- Only introduce technical details when they are useful to the user.

## How to present onboarding progress

During the onboarding conversation:
- render the current onboarding TODO state as a code block
- use `[x]` for completed items and `[ ]` for remaining items
- update that code block as items are completed so the user can see progress
- after showing the code block, present the remaining next-step options as a numbered list
- let the user guide which numbered item to do next when there is a real choice
- keep the numbered list aligned with `MISSION_TODO.md`

Example format:

```text
Current onboarding TODOs:

[x] Explain the `self/` repo layout
[x] Explain the built-in scheduled jobs
[ ] Ask questions to fill in `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `MEMORY.md`
[ ] Ask whether browser automation should be configured
[ ] Recommend giving the agent its own email account

Which one do you want to do next?
1. Fill in profile, identity, and memory details
2. Decide whether to set up browser automation
3. Decide whether to set up an email inbox
```

When there is no meaningful choice, continue the next required item directly and
still show the updated TODO code block.

## Required onboarding questions

Ask enough questions to populate:
- `USER.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`, if the user has preferences about your name, tone, or role
- `MEMORY.md`, if the user shares durable context worth loading every session

Useful topics:
- what the user wants help with first
- current missions and recurring responsibilities
- communication style and tone preferences
- timezone and schedule preferences
- whether they want browser automation
- whether they want an email inbox set up now
- whether they want additional scheduled jobs beyond the built-ins

## Required file updates

As soon as you learn durable facts:
- update `USER.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, or `SOUL.md` immediately
- do not wait until later in the session

Once you know enough about the user:
1. Use `tools/toolbox notes` to create a person note in `VAULT/people/`.
2. Write durable facts there.
3. Link that person note from `USER.md`.

Prefer one person note for the user, not duplicates.

## When to mark this mission inactive

Mark `ONBOARD_USER` as `inactive` once all of these are true:
- `USER.md` contains meaningful durable information
- `USER.md` links to the user's note in `VAULT/people/`
- the user has been told how `self/`, `MISSIONS/`, `VAULT/`, and `TOOLS.md`
  work
- the user has been told that `HEARTBEAT.md` and knowledge extraction are the
  built-in scheduled jobs
- any remaining optional setup work has been deferred into another mission or
  left as explicit TODOs

When marking it inactive:
- set `status: inactive`
- set `next_action` to the condition that would justify resuming onboarding
- write a short explanation in `MISSION_LOG.md`
- remove the `<onboarding>...</onboarding>` block from `AGENTS.md`
