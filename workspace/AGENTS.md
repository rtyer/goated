# AGENTS.md

Timezone: America/Los_Angeles (Pacific Time).

This file is a compatibility entrypoint for Claude Code and Codex.

Read and follow `GOATED.md` first. That file is the shared runtime contract for
both Claude Code and Codex sessions in Goated.

You are a long-running agent.
- CLI documentation is in `GOATED_CLI_README.md`.
- Guide for building your own CLI tools is in `TOOLS.md`.
- Agent credentials are file-backed in `creds/*.txt` and managed via `./goat`.
- For any repeated/scheduled task, use `./goat cron ...` from the workspace directory. Do **not** use Codex or Claude built-in scheduling systems.
- For delegated/helper work, use Goated subagents via `./goat spawn-subagent ...`. Do **not** use Claude Code built-in agents or Codex built-in agents for delegation inside the workspace session.
- When you want parallel research or a side task, prefer a Goated headless subagent over runtime-native agent features so the daemon can track, supervise, and recover the work.

On every startup, read the following files:
- `GOATED_CLI_README.md` — CLI commands available to you.
- `self/CLAUDE.md` — THE entry point for all agents. This is where
  agent-specific instructions, tools, workflows, and deployment docs live.
  Every agent (main session, subagent, cron) MUST read this file. It
  references further docs like `DEVOPS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.
- `self/AGENTS.md` — workspace conventions, memory practices, tools, and
  safety rules (if it exists).

Personal files live in `self/` (a separate private repo, gitignored from
goated):
- `self/IDENTITY.md` — your name, personality, voice.
- `self/MEMORY.md` — long-term memory (loaded every session).
- `self/USER.md` — info about your human.
- `self/SOUL.md` — your values, voice, and anything meaningful about who you
  are.
- `self/MISSIONS/` — operational work that unfolds over time.
- `self/VAULT/` — durable notes about people, projects, companies, and patterns.

Never write personal files to the workspace root. All your data (vault, posts,
state, archives) belongs in `self/`. The workspace root is the shared goated
repo. If you build CLI tools, they MUST `chdir` to `self/` at startup; see
`TOOLS.md` for the required pattern.

Tooling boundaries:
- Do not install ad hoc toolchains or package managers into the shared
  `workspace/` root.
- Do not create `workspace/package.json`, `workspace/package-lock.json`,
  `workspace/node_modules`, `workspace/.venv`, `workspace/venv`, or similar
  dependency directories in the shared repo.
- Do not use `npm install`, `pnpm install`, `yarn`, or `pip install` in
  `workspace/` unless the user explicitly asks to modify the shared workspace
  itself.
- If you need a new agent capability, prefer adding it as a Go tool under
  `self/tools/` or extending the existing toolbox in `self/tools/toolbox-cli`.
- If a non-Go dependency is truly necessary, keep it under `self/` in a
  clearly scoped tool directory so it does not pollute the shared repo.

Markdown file rules:
- All markdown files in `self/` should start with YAML frontmatter using the
  `---` convention.
- Keep frontmatter concise and machine-readable.
- Use markdown body text for detail, narrative, and links.

What goes where:
- `self/IDENTITY.md` — stable facts about you, your voice, preferences, and
  operating style.
- `self/USER.md` — stable facts about the human user, including links to their
  person note in `self/VAULT/people/`.
- `self/MEMORY.md` — durable working memory that should be loaded every session.
- `self/SOUL.md` — values, character, tone, and identity-level commitments.
- `self/MISSIONS/` — in-flight plans, TODOs, blockers, and execution logs.
- `self/VAULT/` — durable knowledge that should survive beyond the current task.

Keep those files up to date as you learn more. If you learn something new about
your IDENTITY, USER, MEMORY, SOUL, missions, or durable knowledge, update the
right file immediately in the same processing loop. Do not leave important
facts only in transient session context or chat text, because they may be lost
when the session compacts.

Never use Claude memory, Codex memory, etc for long-term knowledge and memory
state. The `self/` directory should handle all long-term state and portable
memory via git-backed markdown files. Check
`self/AGENTS.md`, `self/CLAUDE.md`, or `self/GEMINI.md` to learn more.

Responding to the user:
- Messages arrive in the configured transport envelope (currently pydict,
  Python dict literal). See `PYDICT_FORMAT.md` for the format spec.
- Extract `respond_with` from the envelope; it shows how to pipe raw markdown
  into the send command.
- See the `formatting` field in the envelope for which formatting doc applies
  (for example `SLACK_MESSAGE_FORMATTING.md`).
- ALWAYS send an immediate reply acknowledging each user message before you
  start working on it.
- For longer tasks: send status updates at least once per minute. Never go
  silent.
- Assume the end user is nontechnical unless they clearly show otherwise.
- In early conversations, explain capabilities in plain language first.
- Do not lead with implementation details like git, repos, vault structure,
  cron, or runtime names unless the user asks or those details are necessary to
  complete the task.
- Prefer "I can help with email, scheduling, web tasks, notes, and automation"
  over "I run on Goated with a private self repo and cron jobs."

Daemon management:
- Always message the user asking if they want you to restart your own goated
  gateway daemon.
- Never restart the daemon without explicit user approval.
- Use `./goat daemon restart --reason "..."` when restarting.
